	abstract = {This document outlines the basic methodology used to construct the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4) data collection and describes the data sets included in the collection, all of which have been updated as Revision 11 for this release. The Introduction briefly describes the input data, the purpose of the collection, the main characteristics of GPWv4, and lists the data sets in the collection. Details of the methodology, including the sources of the input data used to produce the data sets, are outlined in the Data and Methodology section. The Data Set Descriptions section describes the purpose and content of each data set, as well as available resolutions and formats. Additional sections of this documentation provide guidance on the use of the data, examples of potential use cases, and information on limitations and use constraints.},

	abstract = {The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population density (number of persons per square kilometer) based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second count data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions.},

	abstract = {The Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Data Quality Indicators, Revision 11 consists of three data layers created to provide context for the population count and density rasters, and explicit information on the spatial precision of the input boundary data. The Data Context raster explains pixels with a "0" population estimate in the population count and density rasters based on information included in the census documents, such as areas that are part of a national park, areas that have no households, etc. The Water Mask raster distinguishes between pixels that are completely water and/or ice (Total Water Pixels), pixels that contain water and land (Partial Water Pixels), pixels that are completely land (Total Land Pixels), and pixels that are completely ocean water (Ocean Pixels). The Mean Administrative Unit Area raster represents the mean input unit size in square kilometers and provides a quantitative surface that indicates the size of the input unit(s) from which population count and density rasters are created. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second ({\textasciitilde}1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions.},
